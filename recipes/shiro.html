    <h2>The very famous Shiro</h2>
    <p>
        Shiro is a beloved Ethiopian stew made primarily from spiced, powdered chickpeas
         or broad beans. It's known for its creamy, smooth texture and rich, savory
          flavor, often prepared with aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, ginger,
           and sometimes berbere. Shiro is a staple, especially during fasting periods,
            and is almost always enjoyed scooped up with pieces of injera.
