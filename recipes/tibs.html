    <h2>Ethiopian Tibs</h2>
    <p>
        Ethiopian Tibs is a popular and versatile dish consisting of bite-sized pieces 
        of meat (commonly beef, lamb, or goat) sautéed or grilled with a variety of spices,
         often including onions, garlic, ginger, and the signature berbere spice blend. 
         It can range from mild to very spicy, and its preparation often signifies respect or celebration. 
        Tibs is almost always served hot with injera, the spongy Ethiopian flatbread.
